# Arcade Showcase
I'm working on putting something small together for one of the local retro game / arcade stores. As a kid that experienced what the 90's had to offer, I can't help but love what this place does. I really dig this places aethetic, their character design and the knowledge and experience the people that work there offer. Anyone local to Greensboro, NC should visit Lost Ark Video Games.
